His technical skills and his desire to keep learning are exemplary. He worked in my team for 4 years and I saw him grow tremendously from leadership standpoint. He was a go-to person for the team to resolve complex technical issues. He was the main architect of the test automation framework and managed the CI capability of the team almost on his own. He is extremely detail oriented and has a wonderful work ethic. The whole team looked up to him. I and the team had a difficult time the day he announced his decision to leave. He is a must-have kind of employee in every test automation team and I strongly recommend him. I would very much look forward to an opportunity to have him in my team again.</p>
